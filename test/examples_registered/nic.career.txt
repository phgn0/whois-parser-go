Domain name registration information is required for a variety of 
purposes. Registry provides Whois information through a standard 
text-based network protocol on port 43. Whois information may also 
be viewed on the registry’s web site using a standard web interface. 
Both interfaces are publicly available at no cost to the user and are 
reachable worldwide. The information displayed by the Whois 
service consists of not only the domain name but also the relevant 
contact information associated with the domain. It also identifies 
nameserver delegation and the registrar of record. This service is 
available to any Internet user, and its use does not require prior 
authorization or permission. Access to Registry Whois information is 
provided to assist in determining the contents of a domain name 
registration record in the registry database. The data in this record is 
provided for informational purposes only; Registry does not claim 
accuracy. This service is intended only for query-based access. 
Registry reserves the right to modify use terms at any time; by 
submitting a Whois query to the Registry shared registration system 
(SRS), users agree to abide by the Whois Access Policy.

Terms of Use
Users accessing the Registry WHOIS service must agree to use the 
data only for lawful purposes and under no circumstances use the 
data to:

    Allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission by e-mail, 
telephone, or facsimile of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising 
or solicitations to entities other than the registrar’s own existing 
customers.
    Enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that send 
queries or data to the systems of Registry or any ICANN-accredited 
registrar, except as reasonably necessary to register domain names 
or modify existing registrations.

When using the Registry Whois service, please consider the 
following:

    The Whois service is not a replacement for standard EPP 
commands to the SRS service.
    Whois is not considered authoritative for registered domain 
objects.
    The Whois service may be scheduled for downtime during 
production or OT&E maintenance periods.
    Queries to the Whois services are throttled. If too many queries 
are received from a single IP address within a specified time, the 
service will begin to reject further queries for a period of time to 
prevent disruption of Whois service access.
