The data in the .ICE Whois database is provided to assist you in 
obtaining information about a domain name registration record. ICE 
makes this information available "as is", for information purposes 
only, and does not guarantee its accuracy. The .ICE Whois database 
may be scheduled for downtime during production or operation, 
testing and evaluation maintenance periods.
By submitting a WHOIS query, you agree that you will use this data 
only for lawful purposes and that, under no circumstances will you 
use this data:
(1) to allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission of mass 
unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitations via e-mail , 
telephone, fax or otherwise;
(2) to target advertising in any possible way;
(3) to harass, annoy, interrupt, disrupt or cause nuisance to the 
Registrant or to interfere with the normal business operations of the 
Registrant;
(4) to collect or attempt to collect the majority or entirety of the 
Whois database contents;
(5) in contravention of any applicable legislation or regulations 
including any data and/or privacy protection legislation or 
regulations anywhere in the world; or
(6) to enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that 
send queries or data to the .ICE registry, Registrants, or the systems 
of any Registrar. The compilation, repackaging, dissemination or 
other use of this data is expressly prohibited without the prior 
written consent of ICE. You agree not to use electronic processes 
that are automated and high-volume to access or query the WHOIS
