The WHOIS service offered by SES S.A. and the access to the
records in the SES S.A. WHOIS database are provided for information
purposes only. It allows persons to check whether a specific domain name
is still available or not and to obtain information related to the
registration records of existing domain names. You are not authorized to
access or query our WHOIS  database through the use of electronic
processes that are high-volume and  automated except as reasonably
necessary to register domain names or modify existing registrations.

SES S.A. cannot, under any circumstances, be held liable should the
stored information prove to be wrong, incomplete or inaccurate in any sense.

By submitting a WHOIS query you agree not to use the information made
available to:
  - Allow, enable or otherwise support the transmission of unsolicited,
    commercial advertising or other solicitations whether via email, telephone
    or otherwise;
  - Target advertising in any possible way;
  - Cause nuisance in any possible way to the registrants by sending (whether
    by automated, electronic processes capable of enabling high volumes or
    other possible means) messages to them.

Without prejudice to the above, it is explicitly forbidden to extract, copy
and/or use or re-utilise in any form and  by any means (electronically or
not) the whole or a quantitatively or qualitatively substantial part of the
contents of the WHOIS database without prior and explicit permission by
SES S.A., nor in any attempt hereof, to apply automated, electronic
processes to SES S.A. (or its systems).

By submitting the query you agree that any reproduction and/or transmission
of data for commercial purposes will always be considered as the extraction
of a substantial part of the content of the WHOIS database. You also agree
to abide by this policy and accept that SES S.A. can take measures to
limit the use of its WHOIS services in order to protect the privacy of its
registrants and/or the integrity of the database. SES S.A. reserves the
right  to restrict your access to the WHOIS database in its sole discretion
to ensure operational stability.  SES S.A. may restrict or terminate your
access to the WHOIS database for failure to abide by these terms of use.

SES S.A. reserves the right to modify these terms at any time.
