Dissemination of Domain Registration Information
Domain name registration information is required for a variety of purposes. Registry 
provides Whois information through a standard text-based network protocol on port 
43. Whois information may also be viewed on the registry’s web site using a standard 
web interface. Both interfaces are publicly available at no cost to the user and are 
reachable worldwide. The information displayed by the Whois service consists of not 
only the domain name but also the relevant contact information associated with the 
domain. It also identifies nameserver delegation and the registrar of record. This 
service is available to any Internet user, and its use does not require prior 
authorization or permission. Access to Registry Whois information is provided to assist 
in determining the contents of a domain name registration record in the registry 
database. The data in this record is provided for informational purposes only; Registry 
does not claim accuracy. This service is intended only for query-based access. Registry 
reserves the right to modify use terms at any time; by submitting a Whois query to the 
Registry shared registration system (SRS), users agree to abide by the Whois Access 
Policy.

Terms of Use
Users accessing the Registry WHOIS service must agree to use the data only for lawful 
purposes, and under no circumstances use the data to:
*	Allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission by e-mail, telephone, or 
facsimile of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitations to 
entities other than the registrar’s own existing customers.
*	Enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that send queries or 
data to the systems of Registry or any ICANN-accredited registrar, except as 
reasonably necessary to register domain names or modify existing 
registrations.

When using the Registry Whois service, please consider the following:
*	The Whois service is not a replacement for standard EPP commands to the 
SRS service.
*	Whois is not considered authoritative for registered domain objects.
*	The Whois service may be scheduled for downtime during production or 
OT&E maintenance periods.
*	Queries to the Whois services are throttled. If too many queries are received 
from a single IP address within a specified time, the service will begin to 
reject further queries for a period of time to prevent disruption of Whois 
service access.
