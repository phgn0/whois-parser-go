The WHOIS service offered by the Registry Operator, and the access to the records in the Registry Operator WHOIS database, are provided for information purposes only and is designed (i) to assist persons in determining whether a specific domain name registration record is available or not in the Registry Operator database and (ii) to obtain information related to the registration records of existing domain names.  The Registry Operator cannot, under any circumstances, be held liable in such instances where the stored information would prove to be wrong, incomplete, or not accurate in any sense.

(iii)	for target advertising in any possible way; 
(iv)	to cause nuisance in any possible way to the registrants by sending (whether by automated, electronic processes capable of enabling high volumes or other possible means) messages to them; 
(v)	to violate any law, rule, regulation or statute; and/or 
(vi)	in contravention of any applicable data and privacy protection acts.
